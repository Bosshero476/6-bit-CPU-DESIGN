# 6-bit-CPU-DESIGN
A custom-built 6-bit CPU featuring a 3-bit opcode ISA, XOR &amp; NOT ALU operations, 3-register architecture, 7-word RAM, and support for register, immediate, and branching modes (JLE). Includes full ISA design, ROM module mapping, and Logisim circuit for the CPU implementation.

This repository contains the complete implementation of a custom 6-bit CPU designed using a simplified Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), ROM module, and Logisim-based circuit. The project demonstrates the fundamentals of CPU architecture, control logic, instruction encoding, and memory organization.

🖥 Files Included
•	ISA-Design & ROM Module (1703100).pdf — Full ISA specification and ROM table.
•	6 bit CPU-DESIGN.circ — Logisim circuit implementing the CPU.
